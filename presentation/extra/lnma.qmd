# Living systematic review (LSR): Why, what, how and when

## Keeping evidence up to date

The goal of evidence synthesis, at least from a health research perspective, is to provide the best evidence that are available. Methods for evidence synthesis are well developed [@moher2009group; @higgins2012update], usually being resource intensive, which makes difficult to keep it up to date as new evidence becomes available [@bastian2010seventy].

Traditionally, SRs are not updated or updated sporadically [@garner2016and]. This leaves gaps which may be missing new research that are important.

The "Living Systematic Review Network" has published an overview of LSRs and living guidance recommendations [@elliott2017living; @thomas2017living; @simmonds2017living; @akl2017living]

## What is a LSR?

-   A SR which is continuously updated
-   An approach to do it and not a formal methodology
-   Explicit predetermined frequency of search and review updating

## When is appropiate?

1.  Priority in the context of decision-making
2.  Certainty in the existing evidence is low or very low
3.  There is likely to be new research evidence

## How to perform a LSR?

1.  Protocol
2.  Produce a "baseline" SR, aiming for a smooth transition to a LSR
    -   Search
    -   **Project management**
    -   **Data science**
    -   **Evidence synthesis**
    -   Quality of evidence (GRADE)
3.  Publication
4.  Link to other "living" activities

# Covid-19: LSR and NMA

## Background I

-   The number of randomized clinical trials evaluating vaccines, prophylaxis, and treatments reached 1,000 before August 2020, and is [currently](https://www.covid19-trials.com/) at 3,250.
-   SRs labeled as "rapid" proliferated in the early days of the pandemic, and 1,700 of the COVID-19 relevant reviews are described as [rapid](https://www.epistemonikos.org/en/search?&q=COVID19&classification=systematic-review&fl=4869).
-   Unfortunately, many reviewers use the term "rapid" to justify conducting sub-optimal SRs, including the use of single reviewers for critical tasks such as data abstraction, risk of bias assessment, and assessment of the certainty of evidence.

## Background II

-   Our COVID-19 Living NMA (LNMA) addressing drug prophylaxis, antiviral antibodies and cellular products, and drug treatments [@siemieniuk2020drug; @bartoszko2021prophylaxis; @siemieniuk2021antibody] is a constantly updated SR that has informed the development of a number of World Health Organization (WHO) practice recommendations [@agarwal2020living].
-   With, as of February, 2022, 592 unique trials reported in 992 publications, our group have collected a large amount of data that allows us to address important methodological questions.
-   The need to maintain an up to date, dynamic system for evidence synthesis in the context of COVID-19 can be facilitated using new technologies which comprise both human and machine effort.

## Data science in the context of the COVID-19 LNMA

-   SR activities can be broken down into "micro-tasks". Machine automation can assist with some of these tasks, including routine searching, eligibility assessment, identification and retrieval of full-text reports, and others [@thomas2017living].
- Updated every 2 months.
-   By dividing the work into micro-tasks, our LNMA may be conducted more efficiently among a wider range of people.
-   Our process automation is written in `R` and `Python`, and can be found in our [github repository](https://github.com/covid19lnma/covid19_lnma).

# Conclusions

We have provided an overview of the workflow used in our COVID-19 LNMA. Automation scripts were created with the objective of achieving a continual update of the most relevant evidence. We also aimed to remain flexible to incorporate new developments in the broader evidence ecosystem.
